# TERAGA-X: Slovak Language Transformer & AURORA OS

**Built entirely on Android/Termux by a self-taught developer (no root, no PC, no formal CS education).**

---

## 🇸🇰 What is TERAGA-X?
TERAGA-X is a Slovak language model trained **completely on a mobile phone**. Every line of code, the data pipeline (10GB+ corpus), and the 1M+ training steps happened in Termux.

### 🏗 Architecture (Production vs Demo)
| Feature | Demo (this repo) | **Production (Private)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Layers** | 4 | **12** |
| **Model Dim** | 128 | **512** |
| **Corpus** | Concept | **10GB+ Slovak (Wiki + C4)** |
| **Training** | N/A | **3 Months on ARM CPU** |

## 🚀 The AURORA Ecosystem
The model is part of a larger **AI OS** featuring:
- **100,000+ custom scripts** for monitoring and crypto.
- **Self-healing watchdog** that auto-recovers system modules.
- **DOGA Linux** - My custom distro with 500k+ packages.

## ⚠️ Proof of Concept
I have reached **85% of my vision**. I am sharing this to prove that resourcefulness > resources. This repo is a snapshot; the full "Monolith" remains private for development.
